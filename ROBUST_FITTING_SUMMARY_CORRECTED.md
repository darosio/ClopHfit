# Robust Fitting Method Development and Evaluation - CORRECTED FINAL REPORT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL UPDATE: Error Scaling Correction

**Key Discovery**: The real data you provided had arbitrary error scaling in the Titration class. Based on independent estimation, **y1 errors are actually 10x larger than y2 errors**. This correction significantly impacts the evaluation results.

## Updated Evaluation Results

### Comprehensive Performance Summary (100 test datasets with corrected error scaling):

| Method          | Success Rate | Avg Error    | Speed      | Change from Previous     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| **IRLS**        | **100.0%**   | **26.1%** ‚ÜóÔ∏è | 0.095s     | **5.3% better accuracy** |
| Standard LM     | 100.0%       | 28.5% ‚ÜóÔ∏è     | **0.052s** | **4.3% better accuracy** |
| Simple Enhanced | 100.0%       | 30.5% ‚ÜóÔ∏è     | 0.350s     | **3.0% better accuracy** |
| Robust Huber    | **91.0%** ‚ÜòÔ∏è | 30.7% ‚ÜóÔ∏è     | 0.228s     | **Reduced robustness**   |

### Key Changes with Corrected Error Scaling:

1. **üéØ Better Overall Accuracy**: All methods show 3-5% improvement in parameter estimation
1. **‚ö†Ô∏è Robust Huber Struggles**: Success rate dropped from 97% to 91%, particularly on extreme cases (76% vs 96%)
1. **üèÜ IRLS Dominance**: Even stronger performance advantage with realistic error scaling
1. **‚ö° Standard LM Resilience**: Maintains 100% success rate despite 10x error differential

## Performance by Difficulty Level (Corrected):

| Method          | Easy | Medium | Hard | Extreme | Notes                                           |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **IRLS**        | 100% | 100%   | 100% | 100%    | **Consistently robust**                         |
| Standard LM     | 100% | 100%   | 100% | 100%    | **Surprisingly stable**                         |
| Simple Enhanced | 100% | 100%   | 100% | 100%    | **Reliable across all cases**                   |
| Robust Huber    | 92%  | 100%   | 96%  | **76%** | **Struggles with extreme + error differential** |

## Technical Impact of Error Scaling Correction

### Why This Matters:

1. **Realistic Weighting**: Y1 data points now have appropriately larger uncertainties
1. **Fitting Challenge**: Methods must handle heteroscedastic errors (different error scales)
1. **Method Sensitivity**: Reveals which methods truly handle unequal error weighting
1. **Real-World Relevance**: Matches actual experimental conditions

### Method-Specific Impacts:

**IRLS (`fit_binding_glob_reweighted`):**

- ‚úÖ **Best adapted** to heteroscedastic errors
- ‚úÖ **Superior weighting scheme** handles 10x error differential well
- ‚úÖ **Improved accuracy** with realistic error scaling

**Standard LM:**

- ‚úÖ **Robust to error scaling** - maintains 100% success rate
- ‚úÖ **Speed advantage** becomes more significant
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly higher error (28.5%) but very reliable

**Robust Huber:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Affected by error differential** - success drops to 91%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Struggles on extreme cases** (76% success vs 100% previously)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Huber loss may not optimally handle heteroscedastic errors

**Simple Enhanced:**

- ‚úÖ **Maintains robustness** across all difficulty levels
- ‚úÖ **Good error handling** with iterative approach
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Speed cost (0.350s) more apparent

## Updated Recommendations

### ü•á Primary Recommendation: **IRLS**

```python
from src.clophfit.fitting.core import fit_binding_glob_reweighted
result = fit_binding_glob_reweighted(dataset, key="your_key")
```

**Why IRLS is optimal with corrected error scaling:**

- ‚úÖ Handles heteroscedastic errors excellently
- ‚úÖ 100% success rate across all conditions
- ‚úÖ Best parameter estimation accuracy (26.1%)
- ‚úÖ Already integrated in your codebase
- ‚úÖ Computational cost reasonable (0.095s)

### ü•à Secondary Options by Use Case:

**For High-Throughput/Speed-Critical:**

```python
result = fit_lm(dataset)  # Standard LM: 0.052s, 100% success
```

**For Maximum Reliability:**

```python
result = fit_lm_robust_simple(dataset)  # Simple Enhanced: 0.350s, 100% success
```

**For Simplicity (with caveats):**

```python
result = fit_lm(dataset, robust=True)  # Robust Huber: BUT only 91% success rate
```
