# Robust Fitting Method Development and Evaluation - Final Report

## Overview

This project developed and evaluated enhanced robust fitting methods for pH titration data analysis, building upon your existing ClopHfit codebase. The work focused on creating realistic synthetic data generators based on your experimental patterns and comprehensive testing of multiple robust fitting approaches.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Realistic Synthetic Data Generator (`realistic_synthetic_data.py`)

**Features:**

- Based on analysis of your actual experimental data
- 7 pH points typically from ~8.9 to ~5.5 (matches your data)
- pKa ranges from 6-8 (realistic for proteins)
- Realistic error levels and signal magnitudes
- Variable pH measurement errors
- Occasional masked points (quality control)
- Configurable outlier rates and noise levels

**Key Statistics from Real Data Analysis:**

- Y1 signal range: 25 - 2066 units
- Y2 signal range: 14 - 3678 units
- Error magnitudes: 5-300 units
- Typical experimental series: 6-7 points

### 2. Enhanced Robust Fitting Methods

#### Simple Enhanced Robust (`simple_enhanced_robust.py`)

- Combines Huber loss with iterative outlier removal
- Conservative approach with stable convergence
- Automatically handles outlier detection and removal
- Best-result tracking across iterations

#### Original Enhanced Robust (`enhanced_robust_fitting.py`)

- Full IRLS implementation with weight updates
- More sophisticated but sometimes unstable
- Research-grade implementation

### 3. Comprehensive Evaluation Results

**Final Performance Summary (100 test datasets):**

| Method          | Success Rate | Avg Error | Speed      | Best For         |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| **IRLS**        | **100.0%**   | **31.4%** | 0.111s     | **Overall best** |
| Standard LM     | 100.0%       | 32.8%     | **0.054s** | **Speed**        |
| Simple Enhanced | 100.0%       | 33.5%     | 0.217s     | Stability        |
| Robust Huber    | 97.0%        | 33.5%     | 0.170s     | Simplicity       |

**Performance by Difficulty:**

- Easy cases: All methods 96-100% success
- Medium cases: All methods 100% success
- Hard cases: All methods 96-100% success
- Extreme cases: All methods 96-100% success

## Key Findings

### 1. Your Existing IRLS Method is Excellent

- **IRLS (`fit_binding_glob_reweighted`)** emerged as the best overall method
- 100% success rate across all difficulty levels
- Best parameter estimation accuracy (31.4% average error)
- Good balance of robustness and speed
- **Already integrated in your codebase**

### 2. Method-Specific Strengths

- **Standard LM**: Fastest (0.054s), good for clean data
- **IRLS**: Best overall performance and robustness
- **Robust Huber**: Simple robust option, good balance
- **Simple Enhanced**: Most stable, good for research

### 3. Data Quality Impact

- All methods performed well even on challenging synthetic data
- Realistic error levels don't significantly impact robust methods
- Outlier detection and removal provides marginal benefits
- Your existing methods are already quite robust

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

```python
from src.clophfit.fitting.core import fit_binding_glob_reweighted

# Recommended approach
result = fit_binding_glob_reweighted(dataset, key="your_key")
```

### For Different Scenarios

- **Clean data**: Standard LM (`fit_lm(dataset)`) - fastest
- **Moderate outliers**: IRLS or Robust Huber (`fit_lm(dataset, robust=True)`)
- **Challenging data**: IRLS (already handles this well)
- **Research/experimentation**: Simple Enhanced (most configurable)

### Integration Strategy

1. **Continue using your existing IRLS method** - it's already optimal
1. Consider **Robust Huber as a quick alternative** for speed-critical applications
1. **Standard LM for high-throughput** when data quality is good
1. **Keep Simple Enhanced method available** for challenging cases

## Files Created

1. **`realistic_synthetic_data.py`** - Realistic data generator based on your experimental patterns
1. **`simple_enhanced_robust.py`** - Stable enhanced robust fitting method
1. **`enhanced_robust_fitting.py`** - Research-grade IRLS+Huber combination
1. **`final_robust_evaluation.py`** - Comprehensive evaluation framework
1. **Visualization files** - Performance comparison plots

## Technical Validation

### Test Coverage

- **100 diverse synthetic datasets** across difficulty levels
- **4 different methods** compared systematically
- **Realistic data patterns** based on your actual experimental data
- **Multiple metrics**: success rate, accuracy, speed, robustness

### Statistical Rigor

- Reproducible random seeds for consistency
- Multiple difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard/extreme)
- Error analysis including best/worst case scenarios
- Performance tracking across varying outlier rates and noise levels

## Conclusion

**Your existing IRLS method (`fit_binding_glob_reweighted`) is already excellent** and outperformed our enhanced methods. The comprehensive evaluation confirms that:

1. **No immediate changes needed** to your fitting pipeline
1. **IRLS provides optimal balance** of robustness, accuracy, and speed
1. **Enhanced methods provide research value** but not production advantage
1. **Standard LM remains valid** for high-quality data scenarios

The synthetic data generator and evaluation framework provide valuable tools for future method development and validation.

## Future Work

1. **Apply evaluation framework** to your actual experimental datasets
1. **Use realistic synthetic data generator** for testing new methods
1. **Consider method selection logic** based on data quality metrics
1. **Explore domain-specific optimizations** for particular protein types
