## ‚ö° FAST & RELIABLE FUNCTIONS

Functions with below-median execution time and high stability:

No functions found that are both fast and highly stable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEMATIC FUNCTIONS

Functions with low stability scores (\<30):

- **api_reweighted** (Score: 0.0)
  - Low success rate
  - Poor parameter recovery
  - Not robust to outliers

## üéØ USE CASE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For General Use (high success rate + outlier robustness):

- `fit_binding_lm`
- `fit_binding_lm_outlier`
- `fit_binding (lm)`

### For Speed-Critical Applications (fast + reliable):

- `fit_binding_lm` (0.066s)
- `fit_binding_lm_outlier` (0.040s)
- `fit_binding (lm)` (0.039s)

### For Maximum Parameter Accuracy:

- Use top-ranked functions from stability score

## üßπ CLEANUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### Functions to Consider for Deprecation:

- `api_reweighted` - Poor performance (score: 0.0)

### API Consolidation:

- Keep the unified `fit_binding()` dispatcher as the primary interface
- Maintain the best-performing direct functions for advanced users
- Remove deprecated shim functions after migration

## üìã MIGRATION PLAN

1. **Phase 1**: Update documentation to recommend top performers
1. **Phase 2**: Add deprecation warnings to poor performers
1. **Phase 3**: Consolidate duplicate functions
1. **Phase 4**: Remove deprecated functions in next major version

## üìä STATISTICAL NOTES

- Analysis based on 16 functions across 100 simulations
- Results are specific to the tested conditions (2 DataArrays, outliers in last 2 pH points)
- Consider running additional tests with different data characteristics
- Parameter recovery error is normalized relative error across all parameters
