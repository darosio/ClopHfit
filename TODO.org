- Tit works for a plate organized with a pH-value for each row and a Cl conc
  value for each column.
- Old fit works with a list of well and corresponding cl conc orpH value; the
  kind ["pH", "Cl"] decides

** TODO consider Temp
Some measurements e.g. "A", "C" and "D" are at T = 20 others ("B", "E" and "F")
are taken at T = 37.
This temp is present in each metadata. (e.g. measurements["A"]["metadata"]["Temp"]).

A future note file format:
- well, pH, Cl, T, mut, meas labels
